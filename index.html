                    You just have to moved a heavy piece of furniture and found mushrooms growing on your carpet and you want to know why this is happening. What you need to understand is that the growth of mushrooms is a symptom of a problem, but not the cause of problem. Mushrooms are the natural progression of mold. As mold progresses through its growth cycle, hrom Hypae growth to spore information to spore dispersal to spore generation, mushroom are the final stage.

                    Mold, unlike plants, animals, and humans, do not require light to survive and flourish. But like all other life forms, they do require water. And therein is the starting point for mold growth, a source of moisture/water. When water is allowed to enter into a home or building without being contained, the potential for mold growth explodes. The only other thing that molds need is food source.

                <h2>What Makes Carpet a Mold Food Source?</h2>
                <p>
                    Carpets are constructed of either organic or synthetic materials. Organic materials would include thing such as wool, cotton, silk, and animal pelts. Synthetic would include materials like nylon, polyester, acrylic, and olefin. Since mold needs an organic food source, you can understand the growth on organic carpet materials, but you would think that having carpets made of synthetics would prevent mold growth. Sorry to say that's not the case. Carpets are constructed in layers, called backings, usually a primary and a secondary. During the finishing process a layer of latex is applied to both backing to hold the layers together. Latex is organic, and thus, a food source for mold.

                <h2>What Causes Mold to Grow on My Carpet?</h2>
                <p>
                    Mold is found everywhere and is one of nature's decomposition mechanisms. Mold spores will enter your home on the breeze, on your clothing or shoes, on items that you carry into your home, and they can be carried in on the fur of your pets. Unless you live in a sealed laboratory, there probably are mold spores inside your home at this very moment. If the spores land on your carpet, they will not grow unless there is a source of moisture. This moisture can be a result of a plumbing leak, a roof or window leak, a water spill, or higher than normal humidity. Because mold likes darker environments, it is often found growing on wet/damp carpet underneath or behind furniture. As time passes, it is possible that the mold will produce mushrooms.
